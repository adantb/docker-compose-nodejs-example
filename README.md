# docker-compose-nodejs-example

An example of Nodejs and Mongodb servers built using Docker Compose

Created with the help of this tutorial: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/

And my previous docker example: https://github.com/ashleydavis/docker-compose-basic-example

## To run the Node.js server on your dev pc:

Clone or download this repo, open a command line, change to the repo directory, then install dependencies:

    npm install

Now run the server:

    npm start

Now navigate your browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000/ to view the app.

## Building and running the Docker image in the Vagrant VM
